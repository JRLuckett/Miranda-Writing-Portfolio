Your parents say, “Honey, you’re being dramatic.” Your friends decide the only antidote is happy hour, after hours drinks, beers during lunch, wine and a movie, fucked up Friday, smashed Saturday, Sunday Funday. And you tell yourself that they’re all probably right, that you have to grin and bear it, pound the shot and figure out how to just get through this, you’re still adjusting to adult life, you have a job and that in itself is something to be proud of! And then you wake up and it’s Sunday and tomorrow, you have to go back to work feeling a little emptier than before.\",\"If you’re anything like me, there’s a large part of you that feels unstimulated, unfulfilled and unloved. One of my favorite college professors once said, “There will come a time in your life when pizza, beer and a movie just won’t do it anymore. When you’ll actually have to face what you’re feeling instead of remedying it with a quick-fix.” My friend Chanel and I smiled at each other knowingly because that would NEVER happen to us. Pizza, beer and a movie always makes things better.\",\"Well, I’m almost a year out of school and I’m realizing that my professor was right. There will come a time that you’ll kill a few beers, your pizza box will be empty, the credits will be rolling and you’ll be left feeling sick to your stomach and no closer to the mindset you were trying to achieve by “indulging” or “checking out” than you were before the pizza guy came. So now what?\",\"Here I am, sitting in an office with windows that don’t open outwards to let in fresh air, listening to my CEO Mark scream at his new assistant Andrew about how Andrew can’t get his damn schedule right and how Mark’s water pitcher isn’t filled and how Mark’s extremely constipated and this is ALL ANDREW’S FAULT. I’m not even the one getting yelled at and I have to take a break, excuse myself and go hyperventilate in the bathroom and tell my reflection that I’m beautiful and lovable and it’s all going to be ok. My coworkers send each other catty emails about who’s leaving their dirty dishes in the sink, the “right way” to book the conference room and how someone isn’t paying attention to the chore calendar. Another one of my coworkers only eats El Pollo Loco for lunch and we all share one bathroom. I Tinder at work sometimes because I’m so bored and I need a game.\",\"When I first got this job, I was over the moon. Receiving this job offer was a lifeline for me. I was stuck in an internship at a production company where I “volunteered” four days a week for no pay. I was continuously promised a paying gig but four months later, I still had zero income. I was sending my resume out to hundreds of jobs, hoping one of them would stick. Thankfully, one of them did. I got an interview at a Management Production company where I would be a development assistant in both TV and motion picture lit. I majored in creative writing and literature in college so this was seemingly a perfect fit for me. Plus, I was getting paid and could cover my rent on my own without groveling to grandma.\",\"The first few months were wonderful, probably because in comparison to my last gig, this was heaven. I was reading and writing constantly. No, it wasn’t my own material, but that was ok because at least I was in a creative industry. I’m not sure when things started to turn for me but this feeling of elation was fleeting. I worked extremely long hours and I barely had time for myself. When the weekends rolled around, I worked so hard during the week that I just wanted to go out and have fun. Yet, I would end up getting smashed, only talking to my friends at the bar and eating mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers at Jack in the Box at 3 AM, completely hating myself the next morning. The guy I was dating ended things with me because he turned 30 and wasn’t where he wanted to be in his life professionally. I couldn’t understand why he couldn’t date me and figure his life out at the same time. I was adding to his life, I was giving it love and meaning, right? How could that be a negative?\",\"Now, I think I understand.\",\"I haven’t been doing my own writing because I’m so exhausted and empty, I have nothing else to give when I get home at night. I’m an assistant so I’m an extension of two people. I don’t have my own identity. If I do good work, it’s reflected on my bosses. If I screw up, it’s reflected on me.\",\"I understand paying your dues. It’s necessary, it’s a part of life, it’s how the world works. But the thing is, I’ve started to doubt the end game that I’ve been working towards. We tell ourselves to grin and bear it because someday, it will all be worth it. Yet, just maybe, I don’t want the end game I’m working towards. I’ve always been terrible with change. Even though I’m extremely unhappy, it’s so hard for me to make that first step and dispel the overwhelm.\",\"Sundays are always my worst days. I freak out because it’s the last day before the work week and Monday morning staff meetings give me anxiety. One Sunday a few weeks ago, I laid in my bed and sobbed for a good two hours. I had just come back from a “ladies brunch” at the Huntley Hotel in Santa Monica and I was miserable. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME? I have good friends, I have a nice apartment, I work in entertainment and live in one of the most exciting cities in the world. So what gives?\",\"Happiness looks different to everyone. What I’m slowly realizing, is that it may take on a different manifestation for me than I thought.\",\"In college, I found myself at the bottom of a hole I couldn’t get myself out of. I was forced to leave my undergraduate career and seek professional help. When I returned to college, I wondered if I should switch my major to psychology. I felt the need to give back to others as I had been so selflessly taken care of.\",\"After I was done sobbing that Sunday, I started researching alternatives. I googled creative writing therapist and other made up jobs. I came across graduate programs and zeroed in on one that actually excited me. This was an emotion I hadn’t felt in months. I would undergo training to become a Body Pyschotherapist. I would help patients move through traumas in other ways besides just talking, through movement, art, expressions of self. But what would people say about this career change? I would forgo LA and entertainment to be a dirty hippie in Boulder and study Holistic Psychology? I would, GASP, move home to New Mexico to live rent free and take prerequisites at the community college and work in a restaurant before going to graduate school?\",\"Well, yes. Maybe I will feel differently in a few months. Maybe I will return home and realize I’m insane and that entertainment is the industry for me and fly right back. But maybe not. I’m owning this quarter life crisis because what else are we supposed to do with it? I’m going to honor it because if I don’t, it will drive me crazy. I want to do a pilgrimage before I go to graduate school. I want to have the time to do yoga again. I want to read and write for pleasure. I want to be around to see my little sister grow into a young woman.\",\"So, here’s to all my fellow twenty somethings who feel too old for their age and simultaneously like a small child. Here’s to all of you who work your asses off and have nothing to show for it when you come home but you keep doing it because you don’t know what else to do. Let yourself freak out. Embrace your crisis, let it in and show it the audience it deserves, whatever it may look like to you. Maybe it’s in the form of adopting a golden retriever puppy. Maybe it’s buying a new comforter and studying feng shui and re-designing your room. Maybe it’s selling your furniture and moving to Nicaragua to teach English and be a surf bum. Maybe it’s breaking up with the boyfriend that you don’t love anymore but you’re too afraid to be without. Maybe it’s the principle of saying “yes”. Maybe it’s saying “no” more often.\",\"Any decision that we make right now, twenty somethings, isn’t permanent. It’s ok to change our minds. It’s ok to do things differently than others.\",\"Give in to the crisis and welcome her with open arms.\"]},{\"title\":\"Why Healing From An Eating Disorder Means Talking About It\",\"publisher\":\"Thought Catalog\",\"date\":\"November 3, 2015\",\"content\":[\"Perhaps it’s easier to look away from eating disorders because they are quiet. They are solitary, shameful struggles, raging internal wars that don’t necessarily radiate outwards. And we anorexics, bulimics, over-exercisers and bingers have perfected the art of pretending like everything is fine, just fine. We make it easy to turn the other cheek to our sickness. In fact, we want you to. We assure our friends and family with a smile; “Don’t worry, I already ate dinner earlier.” “Oh no, I’m just feeling kind of sick today. No appetite.” “I’ve only been on the elliptical for 20 minutes, not 3 hours, this timer must be wrong.”\",\"More often than not, the concerned party leave us alone. It would be intrusive to keep pestering, and if someone says they’re fine, you should take their word for it. Right?\",\"Mental health and well-being in general are uncomfortable topics of discussion. When we say someone is mentally ill or has a mental illness, our minds go to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, strait jackets and lobotomies, even though that’s no longer our reality. No one wants to talk about mental illness because it’s terrifying to us. Sadness, depression, weakness, vulnerability; it’s all too much.\",\"Yet, our silence and inability to talk about suffering and the dark parts of the human condition only makes us sicker.\",\"Eating disorders are mental illnesses. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, in fact. They are not a choice, they are not a lifestyle, they don’t only affect vain white girls who want to fit into skinny jeans. They don’t have to look a certain way. They’re not always about control. And men have eating disorders too.\",\"I’m not sure what it is about eating disorders that makes them so taboo. Perhaps it’s the stigma surrounding them, perhaps it’s the lack of education about them, perhaps it’s the feeling of helplessness from the confidante when a victim seeks their help. Either way, the stigma is there and it’s incredibly tangible.\",\"I have struggled with anorexia for four years now. When I first developed my eating disorder, I didn’t know what was happening to me. I knew something was very wrong, but I couldn’t vocalize it. I was embarrassed that I couldn’t feed myself, that I was constantly obsessing about the size of my thighs and about the calories I had or hadn’t consumed that day. I was so ashamed to admit that I felt an incomparable rush from losing weight and that it was the first time in my life I felt powerful and confident. I was even more ashamed to admit that this was no longer something I could control and that it had consumed me.\",\"I found myself in the ACUTE Center for Eating Disorders at Denver Hospital only 5 months after I started my destructive behaviors, hooked up to an IV and a heart monitor because my pulse was dangerously slow and I was at risk of having a heart attack.\",\"My anorexia spiraled so quickly that only now, four years later, am I starting to chip away at it—exploring the reasons behind it, and wondering if I can truly live without it. Only now am I really starting to heal, because only now am I talking.\",\"So please. If you are worried about someone, tell them. If you are worried about yourself, tell someone. When you ask someone how they are, really listen. When asked how you are, try to respond authentically. Let’s make eye contact and try to keep it. Let’s do the harder, more uncomfortable, beautifully vulnerable thing. Let’s start the conversation.\"]},{\"title\":\"Giving Voice to the Stifled, the Neglected, the Heartbroken: Susan Steinberg’s ‘Spectacle’\",\"publisher\":\"ZYZZYVA\",\"date\":\"February 22 2013\",\"content\":[\"Susan Steinberg’s Spectacle (152 pages; Graywolf Press) is a story collection of intertwining vignettes, a series of experimental narratives that speak to the vulnerability of being female and the roles women are expected to play in a male-dominant world. Steinberg does not cast a rosy hue over her portrayal of society. She writes her truth—her female narrators’ truth—and makes no attempt to censor it. The narrators’ voices blend together, as do the male characters: lovers, fathers, and brothers move in and out of one another until they become indistinguishable.\",\"The opening story, “Superstar,” tells of a woman who breaks into an ex-lover’s car and steals his radio. She had been scorned and is trying to salvage a relationship by possessing the remnants of the man whom she fell too hard for and who forgot about her too easily. “I was young and I didn’t steal the stereo because I wanted the stereo. I stole it rather, because I wanted the guy,” she says. There is nothing for the narrator to do but to watch this man go home with another woman as she is left holding the broken stereo.\",\"In “Cowboys,” Steinberg then spins us a story of a woman’s grappling with her father’s death. She is the self-proclaimed killer of her father as she makes the decision to take him off life support. “They say I did not kill my father because they cannot have sex with a woman who killed. What I mean is they cannot have sex with a woman who carries, though all women carry, an unbearable weight.” Women are not supposed to be thieves or killers, only mothers, lovers, homemakers, daughters. Women, as revealed by Steinberg, are to be whoever men want them to be. From the accounts of Steinberg’s narrators, these roles are isolating, lonely, abusive, and a separation from one’s self. “The sigh applies pressure to the woman,” the narrator says. “Then the woman is supposed to give them what they want. Which is to say the woman is then supposed to perform. Which is to say the woman is then supposed to know the subtle difference between being a woman and performing one.”\",\"In “Supernova” a woman tells us of the loss of her friend in a plane crash. Steinberg’s raw writing style causes the reader to grieve along as the narrator reflects on her loss. Then in the following story,“Signifier,” Steinberg gets at the heart of her argument: women fill the roles purported by men because it is terrifying to exist in this world without them. Women are often given no other option but to be defined in relation to men. “But there I was, running to catch up with them,” the narrator says. “There I was, some scared-as-shit girl. I was some scared-as-shit child. Running in wrong shoes up the trail. Scared to be left alone.” It feels wrong, it feels demeaning, but the alternative is to be left alone in the woods.\",\"Steinberg’s biting collection cuts deep. Is it still possible we live in a time that is so backward, so repressive of the feminine? Spectacle acts as the voice of the women neglected, abused, stifled, and heartbroken.\"]},{\"title\":\"Of the Sea\",\"publisher\":\"Literature for Life\",\"date\":\"2014\",\"content\":[\"My father picked Belize.\",\"The decision was his because he was the one paying for the trip. My father has a romance with Latin America, an idealized view of any country or region with Spanish influence. He used to be a diplomat in Quito but that was a long time ago. That’s when the love affair began. I’ve seen pictures of him from his time in the Foreign Service. He has hair down to his shoulders and his eyes look more blue than grey.  He was stationed in Ecuador and became fluent in Spanish, boasting that many locals were so impressed with his accent and proficiency that they asked if he was born there.\",\"“No, no,” he would reply.\",\"“Born in North Carolina, attended the University of Virginia.”\",\"My mother also studied at the University of Virginia, but their paths didn’t cross there. They met years later in Manhattan when my mother’s favorite color was black and my dad had already been married once.\",\"It had been years since my father was able to use his Spanish so he decided on Belize for spring break. My mother was an insomniac then and filled her sleepless nights with Yahoo Answers, strong coffee, and images of vacation destinations. She agreed because she was already well-versed on the Belizian lifestyle, thanks to askjeeves.com. My sister was too young to have a say and I didn’t want to go to Belize because I thought I was in love and if I was apart from him for more than a day, I would probably waste away.\",\"The hotel where we stayed was accessible only by boat. We flew into Belmopan and ate tapas at a restaurant without doors. We waited there for a ferry that would take us to the island hotel and my father conversed with the bartender, moving his hands and rolling his r’s with more vehemence than I had ever heard.  I stared at him, his elbows across the bar made of bamboo and palm, and didn’t know my father. He laughed and I realized that I had forgotten the sound of it.\",\"It was in Belize that I got the most severe sunburn I can remember. My mother shoved a bottle of SPF 75 at me and I refused to put it on, saying that I was so white, I was almost translucent and if I didn’t come back home with a decent tan, this trip would be a complete waste. So I laid out unprotected, wearing a white bikini that my mother said was too tiny, defiantly sipping a virgin pina colada, becoming the color of uncooked salmon. My forehead got the worst of it. It blistered and was so painful that I was forced to remain expressionless for the next few days. I hid under an oversized striped yellow umbrella for the remainder of the trip and watched my father become of the sea. He walked into the water before the sun reached its peak and didn’t emerge until it was almost too dark. He put my sister on his shoulders, just like he used to do with me before I grew up and before he turned inside himself.\",\"My father took pity on me that night because of my raw forehead and allowed me to use his cell phone to call home.\",\"“Only five minutes though. It’s ridiculously expensive.”\",\"I walked away from my family, to the wharf that was further down the beach and called my boyfriend.\",\"It was then that I found out he had gotten into college while I was away, that the college wasn’t near me at all, that the college was Emory and that was in Atlanta, Atlanta was in Georgia, that we were breakable.\",\"My five minutes was up but I wasn’t done talking. My father started to walk towards me, yelling to hang up the phone. I wasn’t ready to give up, not yet, and I started to run. I ran down the wharf, the phone clutched to my ear, wanting to hear that that it didn’t matter that he was going to college in Atlanta, that it didn’t matter that I was still in high school, that we weren’t like those other couples that broke up when college rolled around. We were different, right?\",\"My father started to run when I started to sprint, screaming that this phone call was going to cost him a fortune and that I better hang up right now, young lady, or else.\",\"I reached the end of the wharf. There was only ocean in front of me. My father wrenched the phone away, disconnecting the call, ignoring my wails, tears, curses.\",\"“We are in Belize for god sakes. Look out at the ocean, listen to the language, be here.”\",\"My father was trying to connect, to share with me the love that he had for Central America. He was hoping that his first love would also be mine.\",\"My father let me drive a golf cart the last day in Belize. My mother was terrified and braced herself against the thin body of the cart, holding her breath every time I made a turn. My father didn’t say a word. He didn’t raise his voice when I almost rear-ended the cart of a street vendor who was selling watermelon juice out of glass jars, he didn’t yell and grab the wheel away when I took a wrong turn and became stuck at a dead-end, sandwiched between two houses with mud walls. He looked at me and nodded his head forward.\",\"“You can figure it out. You’ll be just fine.”\",\"And I was.\",\"That night, went back to the restaurant without doors and I stood next to my father at the bar. I couldn’t follow the Spanish he was speaking with the bartender. I was taking French at the time, but I wanted to stand next to him.\",\"I haven’t seen him in a while. That was the last vacation my family went on. My father ran out of money and didn’t know how to get it back. My mother is an insomniac again. My sister doesn’t remember Belize. I tell her stories to remind her. I tell her of the man who spoke with his hands, who taught me how to navigate out of a dead end, who became the ocean, and put her on his shoulders so she could be closer to the stars.\"]},{\"title\":\"Turning Our Personal Truths Inside Out\",\"publisher\":\"Mindset Movement\",\"date\":\"November 2015\",\"content\":[\"I’ve had my fair share of therapy. I’ve talked in circles about my family, my relationships with men, my relationship with myself, my ongoing struggle with an eating disorder, and I was exhausted. Even though I had dug into the deep recesses of my being and brought the darkness out for examination, I still wasn’t fixed. I had been analyzed, assessed and pigeonholed time and time again but I didn’t know what to do with all of it. I believed that once I gained awareness of my thought patterns, actions and past, I would be healed. Yet, this wasn’t the case. Instead, I was tired.\",\"My mother is currently in graduate school, working towards her Masters in counseling. One day after class, she called me to rave about an energy worker who had given a guest lecture. The guest lecturer, Thomas, spoke about how sometimes, in the aftermath of a traumatic event, the human body holds on to trauma in a way that is undetectable to us. If an individual is unable to protect, fight off or assert control in a traumatic situation, the body retains the experience. Often times, we subconsciously recreate a similar situation, trying to work through the previous situation in which we were helpless. The effects can sit in our bodies, making us sick, both physically and mentally, without us even realizing. Thomas claimed that in moving one’s energetic fields, a person’s natural state of being can be restored and the process of healing can begin.\",\"My mother reached out to Thomas after his lecture and asked if he could fit me into his schedule as a new patient. When she told me this, I groaned, feeling like a small child. Secretly, I was grateful. I had forgotten what my natural state of being was, I hadn’t felt it in years. If he claimed he could help me get there, I would see him.\",\"Thomas is a small man with long gray hair, thick glasses and a brusqueness that can be mistaken for dislike. After experiencing trauma in his childhood, Thomas dedicated himself to alternative forms of healing, and came up with a neurological system for transforming and moving trauma within. Hearing his voice over the phone made me nervous and I felt myself leave my body behind when I walked into his office.\",\"I sat in a chair in the middle of the room while Thomas walked in a circle around me, waving pieces of paper around my body, trying to pick up on my energetic fields. I had no idea what he was doing, how waving paper around me was going to do anything for my state of mind and the things that were weighing on me. I wanted to laugh and run out of the room. Instead, I closed my eyes and let him work. He stopped when he circled around to the left side of me. “I’ve found it.” Thomas said that it looked as though I’d been hit in the side of my head with a baseball bat. According to him, the entire left hemisphere of my brain was offline, my body’s protective response to a trauma I experienced when I was 16.\",\"At the end of our session, we sat across from each other. “It looks as though you’ve arrived. Like you’re in your body.” I did feel more present, more grounded. I spend most of time trying to not be in my body because I despise it. Eventually, it became a natural state of mine, to float above myself.\",\"During my second session with Thomas, he did “heart work” with me. He showed me a picture of a spiral galaxy on a piece of white paper. “Which way do you think this galaxy spins?” “To the left”, I said, without hesitation. Thomas nodded knowingly. “That’s what I’d thought you’d say. And in reality, the galaxy spins to the right. You are spinning the wrong direction, that’s why your perspective of yourself and the world around you is so off. We’re going to reorient you.” Was that true? Could it be possible that the way that I saw myself and what I thought to be fact, was actually wrong?\",\"I took a seat in a swiveling chair in the center of the room. “Ok, now spin yourself to the right. I will be standing in the corner, rocking back in forth, feeling your energy.” I nodded. I turned to the right, about a fourth of the full rotation. On the wall was a picture of an iceberg. I noticed the painting in full. I turned myself again to the back wall. A massage table was against it, and pictures of the sun, the moon and Jupiter were hung above the table. I turned again and looked out the window on the leftmost wall. I turned once more, and I finished a full orbit. It was hard for me to spin to the right, it made me feel uncomfortable and almost sick to my stomach. Had I really been askew in space up until now? I kept spinning to the right and eventually, began to pick up speed. It felt better the more I did it, I noticed small details on the four walls I hadn’t noticed the first, second or third time. “Ok, you can stop.” I stopped facing the back wall, staring at the picture of the moon. Everything was still.\",\"“I’m not going to tell you that I healed you, that everything is better. What I did, is make you lighter.” Yes, perhaps Thomas did move something inside of me, but beyond that, he challenged my perspective. He let me know that maybe, just maybe, the way I saw myself wasn’t the truth.\",\"From the time we are children, we learn certain things about ourselves and our personalities from experiences and interactions with others. Some of these teachings are affirmative and positive, but some lead us to believe that we are bad, dirty or flawed in some way and that this darkness is unacceptable. As we grow up, some of these thoughts and traumas can solidify into personal truths and eventually, become a part of us, like an arm or a leg. We don’t wonder about the negative things we tell ourselves because they’ve become so embedded into our psyche and we’ve grown around them.\",\"I wonder if Thomas really did change something inside of me. Regardless of the energy work, he attempted to debunk what I believed to be true about myself by telling me that my perspective and orientation were just plain wrong. No, he didn’t dispel these truths overnight, that would be impossible. Yet, he questioned what I thought to be law and pointed me in a direction I couldn’t seem to find myself. He started a wondering in me. He gave me hope that it wouldn’t always be this hard, and that someday, perhaps my natural orbit will be spinning to the right.\"]},{\"title\":\"Jellies And Storage Boxes\",\"publisher\":\"The Most Excellent Prose\",\"date\":\"May 2014\",\"content\":[\"I’m running down the part of the road that the cars don’t come down and I’m holding hands with Galen. We’re running, sometimes me faster, sometimes him. I’m smiling and my hair isn’t brushed and I don’t care because I’m holding Galen’s hand and I’m wearing jellies. My mother told me to never run in my jellies because it’s not good for my feet but I like the way they look when I run in them and I won’t realize my feet hurt until the night. I’m at the age when my mother gives me headbands with dark pink and muted purples to take my hair away from my face but instead of wearing them correctly, I wear them across my forehead like a crown. All my friends try to fix my headband and make me wear it the right way. Paige gets so angry when I wear my headband wrong but Galen doesn’t. He likes the pink against my forehead and smiles at me with his gap that isn’t big enough to need fixing but where strawberry seeds stay after the fruit is gone.\",\"We’re running from my house to his house, the house that he lives in with his mother Maida and their husky with one eye and Maida’s boy that’s a friend who spends the night and builds coffins for money in the garage. He wears a mask to protect himself from the wood shavings but never a shirt. He plays classical music too loudly while he builds and even though Galen plays the violin, he tells me that he hates the music that Maida’s friend chooses. I don’t understand that Maida’s friend is building coffins. I think he is building big boxes to decorate Maida’s house with, to put things, plants or clothes or books in, to use for storage. I think about asking him to make me one but his eyebrows scare me because they take over his eyes and I don’t want to yell over the crescendo of the orchestra.\",\"We’re running from my house to his house on Upper Pond Road and I hear my mother driving behind us in her Jeep Cherokee, keeping enough distance so we can pretend we’re old enough to run alone but close enough to make sure we get to my house safely and nothing hurts us. She will follow us until we reach the driveway and then she’ll get out of the car to make sure Maida is home, her arms crossed, shielding her eyes against the sun, my father’s flannel shirt playing in the wind. Today we are running faster and we are holding hands and this run is different because he touched his lips to mine on the top bunk after lunch. I was sitting with my feet in front of me and he leaned in and I barely felt his lips but I knew they were there. We don’t say anything to one another, he smiles at me with his gap and I see him as different from me and someone whose breath is warm against the bridge of my nose as he moves away from my face and I now understand my mother’s eyes after my father kisses her on the temple. My family moves away from the house on Upper Pond Road and when we do, I stop seeing Galen. He goes to a different school than I do and then we grow up and we both feel embarrassed that we kissed and if we see each other, we forget and pretend like we are strangers. Sometimes I see Maida but she is never with her boyfriend because he is still in the garage making boxes that shouldn’t be filled. I stop wearing my jellies, I wear my headbands the right way, and then stop wearing them all together. I lose my crown. I’m in high school now and picking at my breakfast when my father asks from the other room what Galen’s last name was. My mother is pouring coffee and she responds through the steam. My father is quiet for a moment and then he tells us that Galen was hit by a train in his car. A service will be held on Sunday. Now I am quiet.

I don’t know if it’s my mother following me in her jeep, far enough away to give me freedom but close enough to see that I get where I’m going, but today, I drive slow enough to keep her near me, to

I write about what it is to be human; the small triumphs that feel so significant, the heartbreaks we fear we will never let go of, the blind bumbling around of growing up, the hilarity of our own neuroses and insecurities. I hang my dirty laundry out to dry in hopes that someone will see themselves in something I write and feel less alone, feel heartened, and know that they are in good company.\n            </p>\n            <p>Most recently, I worked as a script developer and writer for a Golden Girl and long time actress of Hollywood. Our project is currently in post-production. Before that, I lived in Los Angeles and worked as a development assistant to a boutique management and production company, Intellectual Artists Management, which is now Primary Wave Entertainment. Previous to IAM, I worked as a development assistant to the VP of Development at Atmosphere Entertainment, the company that gave us 300, 300:Rise of on Empire, and other testosterone-fueled films. Through my time in the film industry, I have honed an eye for content and know how to identify an idea or story that hasn’t been told told and coax it to it’s full potential.\n            </p>\n            <p>My personal essays appear in Thought Catalog, Mindest Movement, a publication I am currently a staff writer for, and Literature For Life, a nonprofit literary journal where I have acted as editor and special projects manager.\n            </p>\n            <p>I have written three full-length screenplays, as well as a comedy pilot.

Your parents say, “Honey, you’re being dramatic.” Your friends decide the only antidote is happy hour, after hours drinks, beers during lunch, wine and a movie, fucked up Friday, smashed Saturday, Sunday Funday. And you tell yourself that they’re all probably right, that you have to grin and bear it, pound the shot and figure out how to just get through this, you’re still adjusting to adult life, you have a job and that in itself is something to be proud of! And then you wake up and it’s Sunday and tomorrow, you have to go back to work feeling a little emptier than before.\",\"If you’re anything like me, there’s a large part of you that feels unstimulated, unfulfilled and unloved. One of my favorite college professors once said, “There will come a time in your life when pizza, beer and a movie just won’t do it anymore. When you’ll actually have to face what you’re feeling instead of remedying it with a quick-fix.” My friend Chanel and I smiled at each other knowingly because that would NEVER happen to us. Pizza, beer and a movie always makes things better.\",\"Well, I’m almost a year out of school and I’m realizing that my professor was right. There will come a time that you’ll kill a few beers, your pizza box will be empty, the credits will be rolling and you’ll be left feeling sick to your stomach and no closer to the mindset you were trying to achieve by “indulging” or “checking out” than you were before the pizza guy came. So now what?\",\"Here I am, sitting in an office with windows that don’t open outwards to let in fresh air, listening to my CEO Mark scream at his new assistant Andrew about how Andrew can’t get his damn schedule right and how Mark’s water pitcher isn’t filled and how Mark’s extremely constipated and this is ALL ANDREW’S FAULT. I’m not even the one getting yelled at and I have to take a break, excuse myself and go hyperventilate in the bathroom and tell my reflection that I’m beautiful and lovable and it’s all going to be ok. My coworkers send each other catty emails about who’s leaving their dirty dishes in the sink, the “right way” to book the conference room and how someone isn’t paying attention to the chore calendar. Another one of my coworkers only eats El Pollo Loco for lunch and we all share one bathroom. I Tinder at work sometimes because I’m so bored and I need a game.\",\"When I first got this job, I was over the moon. Receiving this job offer was a lifeline for me. I was stuck in an internship at a production company where I “volunteered” four days a week for no pay. I was continuously promised a paying gig but four months later, I still had zero income. I was sending my resume out to hundreds of jobs, hoping one of them would stick. Thankfully, one of them did. I got an interview at a Management Production company where I would be a development assistant in both TV and motion picture lit. I majored in creative writing and literature in college so this was seemingly a perfect fit for me. Plus, I was getting paid and could cover my rent on my own without groveling to grandma.\",\"The first few months were wonderful, probably because in comparison to my last gig, this was heaven. I was reading and writing constantly. No, it wasn’t my own material, but that was ok because at least I was in a creative industry. I’m not sure when things started to turn for me but this feeling of elation was fleeting. I worked extremely long hours and I barely had time for myself. When the weekends rolled around, I worked so hard during the week that I just wanted to go out and have fun. Yet, I would end up getting smashed, only talking to my friends at the bar and eating mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers at Jack in the Box at 3 AM, completely hating myself the next morning. The guy I was dating ended things with me because he turned 30 and wasn’t where he wanted to be in his life professionally. I couldn’t understand why he couldn’t date me and figure his life out at the same time. I was adding to his life, I was giving it love and meaning, right? How could that be a negative?\",\"Now, I think I understand.\",\"I haven’t been doing my own writing because I’m so exhausted and empty, I have nothing else to give when I get home at night. I’m an assistant so I’m an extension of two people. I don’t have my own identity. If I do good work, it’s reflected on my bosses. If I screw up, it’s reflected on me.\",\"I understand paying your dues. It’s necessary, it’s a part of life, it’s how the world works. But the thing is, I’ve started to doubt the end game that I’ve been working towards. We tell ourselves to grin and bear it because someday, it will all be worth it. Yet, just maybe, I don’t want the end game I’m working towards. I’ve always been terrible with change. Even though I’m extremely unhappy, it’s so hard for me to make that first step and dispel the overwhelm.\",\"Sundays are always my worst days. I freak out because it’s the last day before the work week and Monday morning staff meetings give me anxiety. One Sunday a few weeks ago, I laid in my bed and sobbed for a good two hours. I had just come back from a “ladies brunch” at the Huntley Hotel in Santa Monica and I was miserable. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME? I have good friends, I have a nice apartment, I work in entertainment and live in one of the most exciting cities in the world. So what gives?\",\"Happiness looks different to everyone. What I’m slowly realizing, is that it may take on a different manifestation for me than I thought.\",\"In college, I found myself at the bottom of a hole I couldn’t get myself out of. I was forced to leave my undergraduate career and seek professional help. When I returned to college, I wondered if I should switch my major to psychology. I felt the need to give back to others as I had been so selflessly taken care of.\",\"After I was done sobbing that Sunday, I started researching alternatives. I googled creative writing therapist and other made up jobs. I came across graduate programs and zeroed in on one that actually excited me. This was an emotion I hadn’t felt in months. I would undergo training to become a Body Pyschotherapist. I would help patients move through traumas in other ways besides just talking, through movement, art, expressions of self. But what would people say about this career change? I would forgo LA and entertainment to be a dirty hippie in Boulder and study Holistic Psychology? I would, GASP, move home to New Mexico to live rent free and take prerequisites at the community college and work in a restaurant before going to graduate school?\",\"Well, yes. Maybe I will feel differently in a few months. Maybe I will return home and realize I’m insane and that entertainment is the industry for me and fly right back. But maybe not. I’m owning this quarter life crisis because what else are we supposed to do with it? I’m going to honor it because if I don’t, it will drive me crazy. I want to do a pilgrimage before I go to graduate school. I want to have the time to do yoga again. I want to read and write for pleasure. I want to be around to see my little sister grow into a young woman.\",\"So, here’s to all my fellow twenty somethings who feel too old for their age and simultaneously like a small child. Here’s to all of you who work your asses off and have nothing to show for it when you come home but you keep doing it because you don’t know what else to do. Let yourself freak out. Embrace your crisis, let it in and show it the audience it deserves, whatever it may look like to you. Maybe it’s in the form of adopting a golden retriever puppy. Maybe it’s buying a new comforter and studying feng shui and re-designing your room. Maybe it’s selling your furniture and moving to Nicaragua to teach English and be a surf bum. Maybe it’s breaking up with the boyfriend that you don’t love anymore but you’re too afraid to be without. Maybe it’s the principle of saying “yes”. Maybe it’s saying “no” more often.\",\"Any decision that we make right now, twenty somethings, isn’t permanent. It’s ok to change our minds. It’s ok to do things differently than others.\",\"Give in to the crisis and welcome her with open arms.\"]},{\"title\":\"Why Healing From An Eating Disorder Means Talking About It\",\"publisher\":\"Thought Catalog\",\"date\":\"November 3, 2015\",\"content\":[\"Perhaps it’s easier to look away from eating disorders because they are quiet. They are solitary, shameful struggles, raging internal wars that don’t necessarily radiate outwards. And we anorexics, bulimics, over-exercisers and bingers have perfected the art of pretending like everything is fine, just fine. We make it easy to turn the other cheek to our sickness. In fact, we want you to. We assure our friends and family with a smile; “Don’t worry, I already ate dinner earlier.” “Oh no, I’m just feeling kind of sick today. No appetite.” “I’ve only been on the elliptical for 20 minutes, not 3 hours, this timer must be wrong.”\",\"More often than not, the concerned party leave us alone. It would be intrusive to keep pestering, and if someone says they’re fine, you should take their word for it. Right?\",\"Mental health and well-being in general are uncomfortable topics of discussion. When we say someone is mentally ill or has a mental illness, our minds go to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, strait jackets and lobotomies, even though that’s no longer our reality. No one wants to talk about mental illness because it’s terrifying to us. Sadness, depression, weakness, vulnerability; it’s all too much.\",\"Yet, our silence and inability to talk about suffering and the dark parts of the human condition only makes us sicker.\",\"Eating disorders are mental illnesses. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, in fact. They are not a choice, they are not a lifestyle, they don’t only affect vain white girls who want to fit into skinny jeans. They don’t have to look a certain way. They’re not always about control. And men have eating disorders too.\",\"I’m not sure what it is about eating disorders that makes them so taboo. Perhaps it’s the stigma surrounding them, perhaps it’s the lack of education about them, perhaps it’s the feeling of helplessness from the confidante when a victim seeks their help. Either way, the stigma is there and it’s incredibly tangible.\",\"I have struggled with anorexia for four years now. When I first developed my eating disorder, I didn’t know what was happening to me. I knew something was very wrong, but I couldn’t vocalize it. I was embarrassed that I couldn’t feed myself, that I was constantly obsessing about the size of my thighs and about the calories I had or hadn’t consumed that day. I was so ashamed to admit that I felt an incomparable rush from losing weight and that it was the first time in my life I felt powerful and confident. I was even more ashamed to admit that this was no longer something I could control and that it had consumed me.\",\"I found myself in the ACUTE Center for Eating Disorders at Denver Hospital only 5 months after I started my destructive behaviors, hooked up to an IV and a heart monitor because my pulse was dangerously slow and I was at risk of having a heart attack.\",\"My anorexia spiraled so quickly that only now, four years later, am I starting to chip away at it—exploring the reasons behind it, and wondering if I can truly live without it. Only now am I really starting to heal, because only now am I talking.\",\"So please. If you are worried about someone, tell them. If you are worried about yourself, tell someone. When you ask someone how they are, really listen. When asked how you are, try to respond authentically. Let’s make eye contact and try to keep it. Let’s do the harder, more uncomfortable, beautifully vulnerable thing. Let’s start the conversation.\"]},{\"title\":\"Giving Voice to the Stifled, the Neglected, the Heartbroken: Susan Steinberg’s ‘Spectacle’\",\"publisher\":\"ZYZZYVA\",\"date\":\"February 22 2013\",\"content\":[\"Susan Steinberg’s Spectacle (152 pages; Graywolf Press) is a story collection of intertwining vignettes, a series of experimental narratives that speak to the vulnerability of being female and the roles women are expected to play in a male-dominant world. Steinberg does not cast a rosy hue over her portrayal of society. She writes her truth—her female narrators’ truth—and makes no attempt to censor it. The narrators’ voices blend together, as do the male characters: lovers, fathers, and brothers move in and out of one another until they become indistinguishable.\",\"The opening story, “Superstar,” tells of a woman who breaks into an ex-lover’s car and steals his radio. She had been scorned and is trying to salvage a relationship by possessing the remnants of the man whom she fell too hard for and who forgot about her too easily. “I was young and I didn’t steal the stereo because I wanted the stereo. I stole it rather, because I wanted the guy,” she says. There is nothing for the narrator to do but to watch this man go home with another woman as she is left holding the broken stereo.\",\"In “Cowboys,” Steinberg then spins us a story of a woman’s grappling with her father’s death. She is the self-proclaimed killer of her father as she makes the decision to take him off life support. “They say I did not kill my father because they cannot have sex with a woman who killed. What I mean is they cannot have sex with a woman who carries, though all women carry, an unbearable weight.” Women are not supposed to be thieves or killers, only mothers, lovers, homemakers, daughters. Women, as revealed by Steinberg, are to be whoever men want them to be. From the accounts of Steinberg’s narrators, these roles are isolating, lonely, abusive, and a separation from one’s self. “The sigh applies pressure to the woman,” the narrator says. “Then the woman is supposed to give them what they want. Which is to say the woman is then supposed to perform. Which is to say the woman is then supposed to know the subtle difference between being a woman and performing one.”\",\"In “Supernova” a woman tells us of the loss of her friend in a plane crash. Steinberg’s raw writing style causes the reader to grieve along as the narrator reflects on her loss. Then in the following story,“Signifier,” Steinberg gets at the heart of her argument: women fill the roles purported by men because it is terrifying to exist in this world without them. Women are often given no other option but to be defined in relation to men. “But there I was, running to catch up with them,” the narrator says. “There I was, some scared-as-shit girl. I was some scared-as-shit child. Running in wrong shoes up the trail. Scared to be left alone.” It feels wrong, it feels demeaning, but the alternative is to be left alone in the woods.\",\"Steinberg’s biting collection cuts deep. Is it still possible we live in a time that is so backward, so repressive of the feminine? Spectacle acts as the voice of the women neglected, abused, stifled, and heartbroken.\"]},{\"title\":\"Of the Sea\",\"publisher\":\"Literature for Life\",\"date\":\"2014\",\"content\":[\"My father picked Belize.\",\"The decision was his because he was the one paying for the trip. My father has a romance with Latin America, an idealized view of any country or region with Spanish influence. He used to be a diplomat in Quito but that was a long time ago. That’s when the love affair began. I’ve seen pictures of him from his time in the Foreign Service. He has hair down to his shoulders and his eyes look more blue than grey.  He was stationed in Ecuador and became fluent in Spanish, boasting that many locals were so impressed with his accent and proficiency that they asked if he was born there.\",\"“No, no,” he would reply.\",\"“Born in North Carolina, attended the University of Virginia.”\",\"My mother also studied at the University of Virginia, but their paths didn’t cross there. They met years later in Manhattan when my mother’s favorite color was black and my dad had already been married once.\",\"It had been years since my father was able to use his Spanish so he decided on Belize for spring break. My mother was an insomniac then and filled her sleepless nights with Yahoo Answers, strong coffee, and images of vacation destinations. She agreed because she was already well-versed on the Belizian lifestyle, thanks to askjeeves.com. My sister was too young to have a say and I didn’t want to go to Belize because I thought I was in love and if I was apart from him for more than a day, I would probably waste away.\",\"The hotel where we stayed was accessible only by boat. We flew into Belmopan and ate tapas at a restaurant without doors. We waited there for a ferry that would take us to the island hotel and my father conversed with the bartender, moving his hands and rolling his r’s with more vehemence than I had ever heard.  I stared at him, his elbows across the bar made of bamboo and palm, and didn’t know my father. He laughed and I realized that I had forgotten the sound of it.\",\"It was in Belize that I got the most severe sunburn I can remember. My mother shoved a bottle of SPF 75 at me and I refused to put it on, saying that I was so white, I was almost translucent and if I didn’t come back home with a decent tan, this trip would be a complete waste. So I laid out unprotected, wearing a white bikini that my mother said was too tiny, defiantly sipping a virgin pina colada, becoming the color of uncooked salmon. My forehead got the worst of it. It blistered and was so painful that I was forced to remain expressionless for the next few days. I hid under an oversized striped yellow umbrella for the remainder of the trip and watched my father become of the sea. He walked into the water before the sun reached its peak and didn’t emerge until it was almost too dark. He put my sister on his shoulders, just like he used to do with me before I grew up and before he turned inside himself.\",\"My father took pity on me that night because of my raw forehead and allowed me to use his cell phone to call home.\",\"“Only five minutes though. It’s ridiculously expensive.”\",\"I walked away from my family, to the wharf that was further down the beach and called my boyfriend.\",\"It was then that I found out he had gotten into college while I was away, that the college wasn’t near me at all, that the college was Emory and that was in Atlanta, Atlanta was in Georgia, that we were breakable.\",\"My five minutes was up but I wasn’t done talking. My father started to walk towards me, yelling to hang up the phone. I wasn’t ready to give up, not yet, and I started to run. I ran down the wharf, the phone clutched to my ear, wanting to hear that that it didn’t matter that he was going to college in Atlanta, that it didn’t matter that I was still in high school, that we weren’t like those other couples that broke up when college rolled around. We were different, right?\",\"My father started to run when I started to sprint, screaming that this phone call was going to cost him a fortune and that I better hang up right now, young lady, or else.\",\"I reached the end of the wharf. There was only ocean in front of me. My father wrenched the phone away, disconnecting the call, ignoring my wails, tears, curses.\",\"“We are in Belize for god sakes. Look out at the ocean, listen to the language, be here.”\",\"My father was trying to connect, to share with me the love that he had for Central America. He was hoping that his first love would also be mine.\",\"My father let me drive a golf cart the last day in Belize. My mother was terrified and braced herself against the thin body of the cart, holding her breath every time I made a turn. My father didn’t say a word. He didn’t raise his voice when I almost rear-ended the cart of a street vendor who was selling watermelon juice out of glass jars, he didn’t yell and grab the wheel away when I took a wrong turn and became stuck at a dead-end, sandwiched between two houses with mud walls. He looked at me and nodded his head forward.\",\"“You can figure it out. You’ll be just fine.”\",\"And I was.\",\"That night, went back to the restaurant without doors and I stood next to my father at the bar. I couldn’t follow the Spanish he was speaking with the bartender. I was taking French at the time, but I wanted to stand next to him.\",\"I haven’t seen him in a while. That was the last vacation my family went on. My father ran out of money and didn’t know how to get it back. My mother is an insomniac again. My sister doesn’t remember Belize. I tell her stories to remind her. I tell her of the man who spoke with his hands, who taught me how to navigate out of a dead end, who became the ocean, and put her on his shoulders so she could be closer to the stars.\"]},{\"title\":\"Turning Our Personal Truths Inside Out\",\"publisher\":\"Mindset Movement\",\"date\":\"November 2015\",\"content\":[\"I’ve had my fair share of therapy. I’ve talked in circles about my family, my relationships with men, my relationship with myself, my ongoing struggle with an eating disorder, and I was exhausted. Even though I had dug into the deep recesses of my being and brought the darkness out for examination, I still wasn’t fixed. I had been analyzed, assessed and pigeonholed time and time again but I didn’t know what to do with all of it. I believed that once I gained awareness of my thought patterns, actions and past, I would be healed. Yet, this wasn’t the case. Instead, I was tired.\",\"My mother is currently in graduate school, working towards her Masters in counseling. One day after class, she called me to rave about an energy worker who had given a guest lecture. The guest lecturer, Thomas, spoke about how sometimes, in the aftermath of a traumatic event, the human body holds on to trauma in a way that is undetectable to us. If an individual is unable to protect, fight off or assert control in a traumatic situation, the body retains the experience. Often times, we subconsciously recreate a similar situation, trying to work through the previous situation in which we were helpless. The effects can sit in our bodies, making us sick, both physically and mentally, without us even realizing. Thomas claimed that in moving one’s energetic fields, a person’s natural state of being can be restored and the process of healing can begin.\",\"My mother reached out to Thomas after his lecture and asked if he could fit me into his schedule as a new patient. When she told me this, I groaned, feeling like a small child. Secretly, I was grateful. I had forgotten what my natural state of being was, I hadn’t felt it in years. If he claimed he could help me get there, I would see him.\",\"Thomas is a small man with long gray hair, thick glasses and a brusqueness that can be mistaken for dislike. After experiencing trauma in his childhood, Thomas dedicated himself to alternative forms of healing, and came up with a neurological system for transforming and moving trauma within. Hearing his voice over the phone made me nervous and I felt myself leave my body behind when I walked into his office.\",\"I sat in a chair in the middle of the room while Thomas walked in a circle around me, waving pieces of paper around my body, trying to pick up on my energetic fields. I had no idea what he was doing, how waving paper around me was going to do anything for my state of mind and the things that were weighing on me. I wanted to laugh and run out of the room. Instead, I closed my eyes and let him work. He stopped when he circled around to the left side of me. “I’ve found it.” Thomas said that it looked as though I’d been hit in the side of my head with a baseball bat. According to him, the entire left hemisphere of my brain was offline, my body’s protective response to a trauma I experienced when I was 16.\",\"At the end of our session, we sat across from each other. “It looks as though you’ve arrived. Like you’re in your body.” I did feel more present, more grounded. I spend most of time trying to not be in my body because I despise it. Eventually, it became a natural state of mine, to float above myself.\",\"During my second session with Thomas, he did “heart work” with me. He showed me a picture of a spiral galaxy on a piece of white paper. “Which way do you think this galaxy spins?” “To the left”, I said, without hesitation. Thomas nodded knowingly. “That’s what I’d thought you’d say. And in reality, the galaxy spins to the right. You are spinning the wrong direction, that’s why your perspective of yourself and the world around you is so off. We’re going to reorient you.” Was that true? Could it be possible that the way that I saw myself and what I thought to be fact, was actually wrong?\",\"I took a seat in a swiveling chair in the center of the room. “Ok, now spin yourself to the right. I will be standing in the corner, rocking back in forth, feeling your energy.” I nodded. I turned to the right, about a fourth of the full rotation. On the wall was a picture of an iceberg. I noticed the painting in full. I turned myself again to the back wall. A massage table was against it, and pictures of the sun, the moon and Jupiter were hung above the table. I turned again and looked out the window on the leftmost wall. I turned once more, and I finished a full orbit. It was hard for me to spin to the right, it made me feel uncomfortable and almost sick to my stomach. Had I really been askew in space up until now? I kept spinning to the right and eventually, began to pick up speed. It felt better the more I did it, I noticed small details on the four walls I hadn’t noticed the first, second or third time. “Ok, you can stop.” I stopped facing the back wall, staring at the picture of the moon. Everything was still.\",\"“I’m not going to tell you that I healed you, that everything is better. What I did, is make you lighter.” Yes, perhaps Thomas did move something inside of me, but beyond that, he challenged my perspective. He let me know that maybe, just maybe, the way I saw myself wasn’t the truth.\",\"From the time we are children, we learn certain things about ourselves and our personalities from experiences and interactions with others. Some of these teachings are affirmative and positive, but some lead us to believe that we are bad, dirty or flawed in some way and that this darkness is unacceptable. As we grow up, some of these thoughts and traumas can solidify into personal truths and eventually, become a part of us, like an arm or a leg. We don’t wonder about the negative things we tell ourselves because they’ve become so embedded into our psyche and we’ve grown around them.\",\"I wonder if Thomas really did change something inside of me. Regardless of the energy work, he attempted to debunk what I believed to be true about myself by telling me that my perspective and orientation were just plain wrong. No, he didn’t dispel these truths overnight, that would be impossible. Yet, he questioned what I thought to be law and pointed me in a direction I couldn’t seem to find myself. He started a wondering in me. He gave me hope that it wouldn’t always be this hard, and that someday, perhaps my natural orbit will be spinning to the right.\"]},{\"title\":\"Jellies And Storage Boxes\",\"publisher\":\"The Most Excellent Prose\",\"date\":\"May 2014\",\"content\":[\"I’m running down the part of the road that the cars don’t come down and I’m holding hands with Galen. We’re running, sometimes me faster, sometimes him. I’m smiling and my hair isn’t brushed and I don’t care because I’m holding Galen’s hand and I’m wearing jellies. My mother told me to never run in my jellies because it’s not good for my feet but I like the way they look when I run in them and I won’t realize my feet hurt until the night. I’m at the age when my mother gives me headbands with dark pink and muted purples to take my hair away from my face but instead of wearing them correctly, I wear them across my forehead like a crown. All my friends try to fix my headband and make me wear it the right way. Paige gets so angry when I wear my headband wrong but Galen doesn’t. He likes the pink against my forehead and smiles at me with his gap that isn’t big enough to need fixing but where strawberry seeds stay after the fruit is gone.\",\"We’re running from my house to his house, the house that he lives in with his mother Maida and their husky with one eye and Maida’s boy that’s a friend who spends the night and builds coffins for money in the garage. He wears a mask to protect himself from the wood shavings but never a shirt. He plays classical music too loudly while he builds and even though Galen plays the violin, he tells me that he hates the music that Maida’s friend chooses. I don’t understand that Maida’s friend is building coffins. I think he is building big boxes to decorate Maida’s house with, to put things, plants or clothes or books in, to use for storage. I think about asking him to make me one but his eyebrows scare me because they take over his eyes and I don’t want to yell over the crescendo of the orchestra.\",\"We’re running from my house to his house on Upper Pond Road and I hear my mother driving behind us in her Jeep Cherokee, keeping enough distance so we can pretend we’re old enough to run alone but close enough to make sure we get to my house safely and nothing hurts us. She will follow us until we reach the driveway and then she’ll get out of the car to make sure Maida is home, her arms crossed, shielding her eyes against the sun, my father’s flannel shirt playing in the wind. Today we are running faster and we are holding hands and this run is different because he touched his lips to mine on the top bunk after lunch. I was sitting with my feet in front of me and he leaned in and I barely felt his lips but I knew they were there. We don’t say anything to one another, he smiles at me with his gap and I see him as different from me and someone whose breath is warm against the bridge of my nose as he moves away from my face and I now understand my mother’s eyes after my father kisses her on the temple. My family moves away from the house on Upper Pond Road and when we do, I stop seeing Galen. He goes to a different school than I do and then we grow up and we both feel embarrassed that we kissed and if we see each other, we forget and pretend like we are strangers. Sometimes I see Maida but she is never with her boyfriend because he is still in the garage making boxes that shouldn’t be filled. I stop wearing my jellies, I wear my headbands the right way, and then stop wearing them all together. I lose my crown. I’m in high school now and picking at my breakfast when my father asks from the other room what Galen’s last name was. My mother is pouring coffee and she responds through the steam. My father is quiet for a moment and then he tells us that Galen was hit by a train in his car. A service will be held on Sunday. Now I am quiet. I feel sick because I remember that Maida’s boyfriend made coffins for a living.\",\"I take the long way to school that morning, I take Upper Pond Road. In my rearview mirror, a jeep Cherokee comes into view. I can’t make out the driver but I can see long hair that flows halfway down the woman’s chest and a flannel shirt and I feel safe. I don’t know if it’s my mother following me in her jeep, far enough away to give me freedom but close enough to see that I get where I’m going, but today, I drive slow enough to keep her near me, to feel him, to listen for violins and the slap of plastic against the hardened dirt road.\"]}],\"type\":\"projects\",\"projects\":{\"one\":{\"title\":\"WWW\",\"date\":\"\",\"content\":[\"\"]}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./data.json\n// module id = wAIJ\n// module chunks = 0","<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <div>\n      <transition name=\"fade\">\n        <Portfolio v-show=\"visited === true\"></Portfolio>\n      </transition>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <transition name=\"fade\">\n        <Welcome v-show=\"visited === false\"></Welcome>\n      </transition>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nimport { eventBus } from './main.js'\nimport Welcome from './components/Content/Welcome.vue'\nimport Portfolio from './components/Content/Portfolio.vue'\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Portfolio,\n    Welcome\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      visited: false\n    }\n  },\n  created() {\n    eventBus.$on('alreadyVisited', (visited) => {\n      this.visited = visited\n    })\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n<style>\np {\n  color: #AABBBB;\n}\n#app {\n  font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;\n}\n.fade-enter-active, .fade-leave-active {\n  transition: opacity 3s\n}\n.fade-enter, .fade-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/App.vue"],"sourceRoot":""}
